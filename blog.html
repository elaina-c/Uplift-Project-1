          <h1>Meet Elaine: From Curiosity to Code</h1>
          <p>As a child, I had no idea what coding was or what it even meant. But every time I saw people using computers or laptops, I felt a mix of curiosity and envy. I told myself, "One day, I want to be someone who knows how to use a computer." That spark of curiosity became the beginning of my journey into the world of coding.</p>

          <h1>About Myself</h1>
          <p>When I started in the ICT strand, I didn’t really know what I wanted for the future. But I was happy because I could use a computer for two hours every school day. I really enjoyed it.</p>

          <h1>My Background</h1>
          <p>I actually finished my work immersion training at Bicutan Med as a finance assistant. Even though it wasn’t directly related to coding, I was still able to use a computer to compute budgets and do other tasks. It also gave me a chance to experience working in an office environment.</p>

          <h1>How I Got Into Coding</h1>
          <p>I became interested in web development when I realized how websites are built and how powerful coding can be. At first, I didn’t know where to start, but I got motivated through school and some online videos. Later on, I joined Uplift Code Camp, which really helped me understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and how websites work. That’s when I truly started to enjoy coding and saw it as something I want to keep learning.</p>

          <h1>What I Enjoy About Coding</h1>
          <p>My favorite part of coding is designing websites and seeing the results live on the screen—it feels exciting to bring ideas to life! Right now, I really enjoy using HTML and CSS to build and style pages. I'm also starting to explore JavaScript to make websites more interactive.</p>

          <h1>Other Things I Love</h1>
          <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy music, art, reading, and watching anime. I also love coffee—it's my go-to boost during study sessions! In my free time, I like playing games to relax and have fun.

          <h1>My Goals</h1>
          <p>Right now, I'm continuing my training at Uplift Code Camp, learning more about web development each day. In the short term, I want to become a skilled front-end developer and work with a team where I can grow and learn more. In the long run, I dream of building my own apps and being part of something that makes a difference through technology.</p>
